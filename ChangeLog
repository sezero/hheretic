HHeretic ChangeLog

v0.2.2-svn
 - fixed ENDTEXT printing.

v0.2.1
 - added packed attribute to some disk data structures which were
   accidentally missed in hheretic-0.2.0.
 - fixed player movement for environments where the char type is
   unsigned by default.
 - made detSideFloat() and findIntersectionVertex() to compile
   without optimizations, at least for gcc >= 4.4, providing some
   partial solution to opengl clipping problems.
 - added -nomidi as a new command line option.

v0.2.0
 - Support for 64 bit machines.
 - Support for big endian machines.
 - FreeBSD support.
 - Fixed structure packing enabling support for ARM, etc.
 - Support for newest gcc versions.
 - Updated build system with new configuration options.
 - Added SDL and SDL_mixer sound drivers in addition to OSS. SDL is
   the default. Can be changed by configure.
 - External ogg/mp3 music playback with the sdlmixer driver.
 - User directories fully implemented: $HOME/.hheretic
 - Added a shared data path system for the game's data files such as
   the wad files, external music files, etc. The shared data path is
   decided in the following order:
   * -waddir <DIR>  command line option,
   * HERETIC_DATA  environment variable,
   * --with-datapath=<DIR>  configure (compile time) option,
   * current working directory which has always been used as
     the last resort.
 - Screenshots, both opengl and software mode, work. Bound to F12.
 - Added Barry Mead's transparent automap feature.
 - Added key configuration menu from HHexen.
 - OpenGL: Implemented finale screens of the episodes 2 and 3.
 - OpenGL: Life chain's left and right ends darkened properly.
 - Fixed the ANSI endtext to work properly on wide consoles.
 - Added svgalib video driver from HHexen.
 - A lot of bug fixes. All fixes went into hhexen up to hhexen-1.6.0,
   also went into hheretic.
 - Synchronized the source code with hhexen wherever possible.

v0.1
 - Initial release by Dan Olson
